abstract = {The CM carbonaceous chondrites have all been aqueously altered, and some of them were subsequently heated in a parent body environment. Here we have sought to understand the impact of short duration heating on a highly aqueously altered CM through laboratory experiments on Allan Hills (ALH) 83100. Unheated ALH 83100 contains 83 volume per cent serpentine within the fine-grained matrix and altered chondrules. The matrix also hosts grains of calcite and dolomite, which are often intergrown with tochilinite, Fe(Ni) sulphides (pyrrhotite, pentlandite), magnetite and organic matter. Some of the magnetite formed by replacement of Fe(Ni) sulphides that were accreted from the nebula. Laboratory heating to 400 °C has caused partial dehydroxylation of serpentine and loss of isotopically light oxygen leading to an increase in bulk $\delta$18O and fall in $\Delta$17O. Tochilinite has decomposed to magnetite, whereas carbonates have remained unaltered. With regards to infrared spectroscopy (4000–400 cm−1; 2.5–25 µm), heating to 400 °C has resulted in decreased emissivity (increased reflectance), a sharper and more symmetric OH band at 3684 cm−1 (2.71 µm), a broadening of the Si[sbnd]O stretching band together with movement of its minimum to longer wavenumbers, and a decreasing depth of the Mg[sbnd]OH band (625 cm−1; 16 µm). The Si[sbnd]O bending band is unmodified by mild heating. With heating to 800 °C the serpentine has fully dehydroxylated and recrystallized to ∼Fo60/70 olivine. Bulk $\delta$18O has further increased and $\Delta$17O decreased. Troilite and pyrrhotite have formed, and recrystallization of pentlandite has produced Fe,Ni metal. Calcite and dolomite were calcined at ∼700 °C and in their place is an un-named Ca-Fe oxysulphide. Heating changes the structural order of organic matter so that Raman spectroscopy of carbon in the 800 °C sample shows an increased (D1 + D4) proportional area parameter. The infrared spectrum of the 800 °C sample confirms the abundance of Fe-bearing olivine and is very similar to the spectrum of naturally heated stage IV CM Pecora Escarpment 02010. The temperature-related mineralogical, chemical, isotopic and spectroscopic signatures defined in ALH 83100 will help to track the post-hydration thermal histories of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, and samples returned from the primitive asteroids Ryugu and Bennu.},

abstract = {Many boulders on (101955) Bennu, a near-Earth rubble pile asteroid, show signs of in situ disaggregation and exfoliation, indicating that thermal fatigue plays an important role in its landscape evolution. Observations of particle ejections from its surface also show it to be an active asteroid, though the driving mechanism of these events is yet to be determined. Exfoliation has been shown to mobilize disaggregated particles in terrestrial environments, suggesting that it may be capable of ejecting material from Bennu's surface. We investigate the nature of thermal fatigue on the asteroid, and the efficacy of fatigue-driven exfoliation as a mechanism for generating asteroid activity, by performing finite element modeling of stress fields induced in boulders from diurnal cycling. We develop a model to predict the spacing of exfoliation fractures and the number and speed of particles that may be ejected during exfoliation events. We find that crack spacing ranges from {\~{}}1 mm to 10 cm and disaggregated particles have ejection speeds up to {\~{}}2 m/s. Exfoliation events are most likely to occur in the late afternoon. These predictions are consistent with observed ejection events at Bennu and indicate that thermal fatigue is a viable mechanism for driving asteroid activity. Crack propagation rates and ejection speeds are greatest at perihelion when the diurnal temperature variation is largest, suggesting that events should be more energetic and more frequent when closer to the Sun. Annual thermal stresses that arise in large boulders may influence the spacing of exfoliation cracks or frequency of ejection events.},

A multidisciplinary team of scientists generated and codified a range of scientific hypotheses distilled into a Science Traceability Matrix (STM) that defined the set of objectives pursued in a series of extravehicular activity (EVA) campaigns performed across multiple field deployments. This STM was used to guide the pre-deployment selection of sampling stations within the selected Mars analog sites on the Earth based on precursor site information such as multispectral imagery. It also informed selection of hand-held instruments and observational data to collect during EVA to aid sample selection through latency-impacted interaction with an Earth-based Science Support Team. A significant portion of the pre-deployment strategic planning activities were devoted to station selection, ultimately the locations used for sample collection and EVA planning. During development of the EVAs, the BASALT science team identified lessons learned that could be used to inform future missions and analog activities, including the critical need for high-resolution precursor imagery that would enable the selection of stations that could meet the scientific objectives outlined in the STM.},

Regions within the eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho and the Big Island of Hawai'i, the United States, provinces that represent analogs of present-day and early Mars, respectively, were evaluated on the basis of geologic settings, rock lithology and geochemistry, rock alteration, and climate. Each of these factors provides rationale for the selection of specific targets for field research in five analog target regions: (1) Big Craters and (2) Highway lava flows at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Idaho, and (3) Mauna Ulu low shield, (4) Kīlauea Iki lava lake, and (5) Kīlauea caldera in the Kīlauea Volcano summit region and the East Rift Zone of Hawai'i. Our evaluation of compositional and textural attributes, as well as the effects of syn-and posteruptive rock alteration, shows that basaltic terrains in Idaho and Hawai'i provide a way to characterize the geology and major geologic substrates that host biological activity of relevance to Mars exploration. This work provides the foundation to better understand the scientific questions related to the habitability of basaltic terrains, the rationale behind selecting analog field targets, and their applicability as analogs to Mars.},

abstract = {A major objective in the exploration of Mars is to test the hypothesis that the planet hosted life. Even in the absence of life, the mapping of habitable and uninhabitable environments is an essential task in developing a complete understanding of the geological and aqueous history of Mars and, as a consequence, understanding what factors caused Earth to take a different trajectory of biological potential. We carried out the aseptic collection of samples and comparison of the bacterial and archaeal communities associated with basaltic fumaroles and rocks of varying weathering states in Hawai'i to test four hypotheses concerning the diversity of life in these environments. Using high-Throughput sequencing, we found that all these materials are inhabited by a low-diversity biota. Multivariate analyses of bacterial community data showed a clear separation between sites that have active fumaroles and other sites that comprised relict fumaroles, unaltered, and syn-emplacement basalts. Contrary to our hypothesis that high water flow environments, such as fumaroles with active mineral leaching, would be sites of high biological diversity, alpha diversity was lower in active fumaroles compared to relict or nonfumarolic sites, potentially due to high-Temperature constraints on microbial diversity in fumarolic sites. A comparison of these data with communities inhabiting unaltered and weathered basaltic rocks in Idaho suggests that bacterial taxon composition of basaltic materials varies between sites, although the archaeal communities were similar in Hawai'i and Idaho. The taxa present in both sites suggest that most of them obtain organic carbon compounds from the atmosphere and from phototrophs and that some of them, including archaeal taxa, cycle fixed nitrogen. The low diversity shows that, on Earth, extreme basaltic terrains are environments on the edge of sustaining life with implications for the biological potential of similar environments on Mars and their exploration by robots and humans.},

Handheld spectrometers that are capable of in situ analyses are already used for geological exploration on Earth; however, their usefulness for human exploration missions and how data from multiple handheld instruments could be combined to enhance scientific return must be further evaluated. As part of the Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) research project, we incorporated two handheld instruments, a visible-near infrared spectrometer and an X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer, into simulated Mars exploration missions conducted on basaltic terrains in Idaho and Hawai'i. To understand the data quality provided by these handheld spectrometers, we evaluated their performance under varying conditions of measurement time, distance, angle, atmosphere, and sample matrix, and we compared data quality between handheld instruments and laboratory techniques. Here, we summarize these findings, provide guidelines and requirements on how to effectively incorporate these instruments into human exploration missions to Mars, and posit that future iterations of these instruments will be beneficial for enhancing science returned from human exploration missions.},

abstract = {Science-driven, human spaceflight missions of the future will rely on regular and interactive communication between Earth-and space-based teams during activity in which astronauts work directly on Mars or other planetary surfaces (extravehicular activity, EVA). The Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) project conducted simulated human missions to Mars, complete with realistic one-way light time (OWLT) communication latency. We discuss the modes of communication used by the Mars-and Earth-based teams, including text, audio, video, and still imagery. Real-Time communication between astronauts in the field (extravehicular, EV) and astronauts in a communication relay station (intravehicular, IV) was broadcast over OWLT, providing important contextual information to the Science Backroom Team (SBT) in Mission Control. Collaborative communication between the Earth-and Mars-based teams, however, requires active communication across latency via the Mission Log. We provide descriptive statistics of text communication between IV and SBT in a high-fidelity, scientifically driven analog for human space exploration. Over an EVA, the SBT sent an average of ∼23 text messages containing recommendations, requests, and answers to questions, while the science-focused IV crew member (IV2) sent an average of ∼38 text messages. Though patterns varied, communication between the IV and SBT teams tended to be highest during ∼50-150 min into the EVA, corresponding to the candidate sample search and presampling instrument survey phases, and then decreased dramatically after minute ∼200 during the sample collection phase. Generally, the IV2 and SBT used ∼4.6 min to craft a reply to a direct question or comment, regardless of message length or OWLT, offering a valuable glimpse into actual time-To-reply. We discuss IV2-SBT communication within the context of case examples from an EVA during which communication failures affected operations in the field. Finally, we offer recommendations for communication practices for use in future analogs and, perhaps, science-driven human spaceflight.},

abstract = {The CM and CI carbonaceous chondrites are typically dominated by phyllosilicates with variable proportions of tochilinite, anhydrous silicates, carbonates, sulfides, sulfates, oxides, and organic compounds. During thermal metamorphism the phyllosilicates dehydrate and decompose yielding water and olivine/enstatite. The thermal transformation of carbonate is less well understood, especially in the presence of volatile decomposition products, such as CO, CO2, SO2, H2S, and H2O. Here is described the mineralogical transformation of calcite (CaCO3) to oldhamite (CaS) and portlandite [Ca(OH)2] during extraterrestrial thermal metamorphism on the Sutter's Mill parent body. Sutter's Mill is a regolith breccia consisting of at least two lithologic components: phyllosilicate-calcite-bearing and anhydrous olivine-rich. Evidence suggests that the anhydrous stones were derived from extraterrestrial heating of the phyllosilicate-calcite-bearing material. One of only three Sutter's Mill stones (SM3) collected prior to heavy rainfall over the recovery site is the focus of this study. Its powder X-ray diffraction patterns are dominated by olivine, with lesser enstatite, Fe-sulfides, magnetite, and oldhamite. Oldhamite is absent in the rained-on stones reflecting its water sensitivity and the pristine nature of SM3. Optical micrographs show whitish to bluish grains of oldhamite and portlandite embedded in dark, fine-grained matrix. The presence of abundant olivine and absence of phyllosilicates, tochilinite, and carbonate indicates that SM3 underwent heating to ∼750 °C. At this temperature, calcite would have decomposed to lime (CaO). Volatilization experiments show that CO, CO2, SO2, and H2S evolve from CM and CI chondrites heated above 600 °C. Lime that formed through calcite decomposition would have reacted with these gases forming oldhamite under reducing conditions. Residual lime not converted to oldhamite, would have readily hydrated to portlandite, possibly through retrograde reactions during cooling on the parent body. These reactions have parallels to those in coal-fired electricity generating plants and provide an analogous system to draw comparison. Furthermore, the identification of these minerals, which are sensitive to terrestrial alteration, and determination of their formation is enabled only by the rapid collection of samples from an observed fall and their subsequent curation.},

abstract = {Using infrared (IR) spectroscopy of thin sections, we characterize the relative degree of aqueous alteration and subsequent heating of a suite of CM chondrites to document spectral indicators of these processes that can contextualize observations of carbonaceous asteroids. We find that the progressive aqueous alteration of CMs manifests in two spectral regions. The low-wavenumber region (1200–400 cm−1; 8–25 $\mu$m) records the increasing proportion of Mg-Fe phyllosilicates relative to anhydrous silicates as aqueous alteration proceeds, with a highly correlated shift of the Christiansen feature (CF) to lower wavenumber and the Si-O bending band minimum to higher wavenumber, and an increase in depth of the Mg-OH band ({\~{}}625 cm−1). The strongest correlation (R2 = 0.90) with petrologic subtype is the distance between the CF and Si-O stretching band minimum, which predicts the petrologic subtype of the sample to within 0.1. The high-wavenumber region (4000–2500 cm−1, ≤3.33 $\mu$m) probes the variation in abundance and composition of Mg-Fe serpentine and tochilinite among the altered CMs. All moderately to highly altered CMs (≤2.3) have an OH/H2O (‘3 $\mu$m') band emission maximum of 3690 cm−1 (2.71 $\mu$m) indicative of Mg-bearing serpentine, and mildly aqueously altered CMs (≥ 2.5) have a wider band with a complex shape that results from contributions of Fe-bearing serpentine and tochilinite. Among weakly heated CMs (Stage II; 300–500 °C), the low-wavenumber region exhibits spectral features resulting from the dehydration and dehydroxylation of phyllosilicates that include broadening of the Si-O stretching band and a shift of its minimum to lower wavenumber, and the disappearance of the Mg-OH band. The location of the Si-O bending band minimum appears to be unaffected by mild heating. Extensively heated CMs (Stage III+; {\textgreater} 500 °C) have a low-wavenumber region dominated by the spectral features of secondary, Fe-bearing olivine and low-Ca pyroxene and thus are readily distinguished from unheated and mildly heated CMs. The OH/H2O band of all heated CMs is broad and rounded with an emission peak at lower wavenumbers (≤3636 cm−1; ≥2.75 $\mu$m) than in unheated CMs. However, spectral and petrographic evidence suggests that our heated CMs have been compromised by terrestrial rehydration. Our study confirms that thermal metamorphism effects are concentrated within the matrix and suggests that the matrix of the CM WIS 91600 had a CI-like mineralogy prior to heating.},

abstract = {Early spectral data from the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission reveal evidence for abundant hydrated minerals on the surface of near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu in the form of a near-infrared absorption near 2.7 µm and thermal infrared spectral features that are most similar to those of aqueously altered CM-type carbonaceous chondrites. We observe these spectral features across the surface of Bennu, and there is no evidence of substantial rotational variability at the spatial scales of tens to hundreds of metres observed to date. In the visible and near-infrared (0.4 to 2.4 µm) Bennu's spectrum appears featureless and with a blue (negative) slope, confirming previous ground-based observations. Bennu may represent a class of objects that could have brought volatiles and organic chemistry to Earth.},
